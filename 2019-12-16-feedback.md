# Nick Barnard - BE Northcoders News

## Readme

- [ ] Link to hosted version
- [ ] Write a summary of what the project is --> A bit of description of what it does, and what the user can do with it.
- [ ] Provide clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests --> running the tests section need to be finished.
- [ ] Include information about how to create `knexfile.js`

## General

- [ ] Remove any unnecessary `console.logs` and comments
- [ ] Remove all unnecessary files (e.g. old `README.md`, `error-handling.md`, `hosting.md`, `./db/utils/README.md` etc.)

## Migrations

- [ ] Use `notNullable` on required fields ---> body and topics in articles table
- [ ] Default `created_at` in articles and comments tables to the current date:`.defaultTo(knex.fn.now());`
- [ ] Delete all comments when the article they are related to is deleted: Add `.onDelete("CASCADE");` to `article_id` column in `comments` table.

## Seeding

- [ ] Migrate rollback and migrate latest in seed function before the conection with topics and users is made.

## Tests

- [ ] Cover all endpoints and errors
- [ ] Ensure all tests are passing

## Controllers

- Add catch blocks to all model invocations --> missind in `fetchApi` invokation model.

## Models

- No unnecessary use of `.modify()` (i.e. only for author and topic queries) ---> you can have more than one if statement within the same `modify`.

- When doing `checkAuthorExists`, `checkTopicExists` and `checkArticleExists` they are models, so they should be ina utils in models or inside each specific model. And so the tests should be in your end points tests rather than in the other utility functions files.
